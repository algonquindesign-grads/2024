about_me: |
  Hi, I’m Hannah (G) — i’m a mid-twenties-something woman, who lives in the ottawa area.  The work I am proudest of focuses on my illustrative and typographic skills. On my way out of this program, I am looking forward to developing my understanding of design further. I would like to thank my cat, Hazel, who’s judgemental attitude got me through at least 3-4 major projects.
