about_me: |
  Throughout this program, I’ve gained experience in many aspects of graphic design and I am excited to step into the field. I am grateful that this program has prepared me with a portfolio of works that demonstrate my skill sets. I look forward to exploring new styles while collaborating with clients and offering design solutions. Creating new, meaningful, and inclusive designs is my goal for the future.
