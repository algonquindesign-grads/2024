about_me: |
  I'm the kind of creative cat who likes to mix things up and usually is the first one to have a style thats – a bit out there. My journey through the graphic design program has been a crazy one. It has changed everything about me and the ways that I learn. it’s changed my creativity style and made me learn about not just colour theories and layouts but made me learn more about myself and how to become more confident about my work.
