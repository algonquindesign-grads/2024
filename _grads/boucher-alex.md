about_me: |
  I am a graphic designer that is passionate about research, history and diving deep into projects. I am huge fan of 1960s and 1970s design and like to incorporate this style, when appropriate. My experience during the Graphic Design program was extremely positive, I am grateful to have learned so much over the past 3 years and can’t wait to keep learning throughout my career in Graphic Design.
