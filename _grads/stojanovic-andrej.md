about_me: |
  I like using a minimal approach to my designs as it keeps everything clean, and it's easier to avoid mistakes that way. I try to be as detail-oriented and precise as possible while using a low amount of assets. The Graphic Design program itself was a great experience and I got to grow as a designer in many different areas. I think there are certain Adobe applications that I would have never gotten myself to start learning if it wasn't for the program itself.
