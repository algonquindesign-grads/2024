about_me: |
  My name is Shannon and I’m a motion designer and illustrator specializing in 2D animation and vector illustration. My passion for learning leads me to find new ways to tell stories that are bold and dynamic, and I am inspired by all things cute, whimsical, and scary. I look forward to continuously improving my traditional illustration and animation skills, as well as continuing to implement new technologies and adapt to the industry as it changes.
