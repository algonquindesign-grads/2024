about_me: |
  Hey, it's Dreami. I am a freelance Graphic Designer and Ilustrator passionate about minimalist and modern design. I create brand identities, user interfaces, packaging, websites, and everything in-between to make brands successful. I love drinking jasmine tea, cozying up in my PJs for a movie night with my feline friend, and above all, immersing myself in the world of graphic design.

  In 2023, while the product itself remained peerless in terms of quality ingredients, the brand’s packaging and wider identity was looking out of touch with modern consumers and the Instagram era. Our challenge was simple: get Mery Dairy  back to its accessible luxury best.
