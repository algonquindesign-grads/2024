about_me: |
  Ever wonder what happens when imagination meets pixels? Hi iâ€™m Kier ðŸ™‚ a creative soul with a passion for graphic design and bringing ideas to life through design. My design philosophy is centred around the belief that great design is not just about aestheticsâ€”it's about telling compelling stories and creating meaningful connections. I love working closely with clients to bring their visions to life in ways they never imagined possible. Take a peak at my portfolio and let's turn visions into visuals!

portfolio_title1: "Craft Beer Design"
portfolio_description1: |
  Introducing "Beaver Ales," a uniquely Canadian craft beer collaboration between Beyond The Pale and BeaverTails. Infused with cinnamon spice reminiscent of the iconic pastry, its can design features the iconic Canadian beaver, with a nod to the brand's signature fence illustration cleverly incorporated into its teeth for a touch of whimsy and brand consistency.
portfolio_title2: "Eco-Friendly Redesign"
portfolio_description2: |
  Introducing the eco-friendly packaging redesign for Nesquik's chocolate milk powder! From an outdated plastic tub design from the 90s to an innovative and modern milk carton design. This product is small, self-closing, made from 100% sustainable materials, and correlates with Nesquick's more modern style of product design and branding!
portfolio_title3: " Personal Branding"
portfolio_description3: |
  By far, one of my favourite yet most difficult projects was developing my own personal brand identity! A unique mix of bold and impactful, yet elegant and feminine. Meet Kiersten Anne, the passionate graphic designer ready to turn your visions into visuals!
portfolio_title4: "Movie Poster Design"
portfolio_description4: |
  Fun fact: I decided to create this movie poster because I personally hated the movie when I watched it in theatres! As a designer, we inevitably will be challenged with projects that we do not have interest in nor care for. Take a peek at my personal take on the Wonka 2023 poster design, bringing back twists from the original Hershey's bar and aspects from the previous variations of the Wonka films!
