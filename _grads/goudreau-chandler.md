about_me: |
  Despite learning After Effects a year ago, I’ve already accumulated 35 minutes of story-driven animation. My background in music and acting enhances my projects with music compositions and voice-acting skills. I also serve as the lead vocalist and graphic designer for my goth band, handling things like branding, cover art, and web/merch design. Our fanbase has been swiftly growing, with our music featured on radio stations and in clubs worldwide!
