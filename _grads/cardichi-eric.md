about_me: |
  I began my freelance career in high school, creating cover art for local artists. Since then I've been expanding my services and mastering my craft. With years of experience with a wide range of clients, I've worked on various projects, from branding guides to social media content and more. In 2022, I was brought onto the HEARTSRFALLIN team as a co-owner, board member, shareholder, and Head of Design.
