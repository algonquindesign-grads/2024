about_me: |
  Hey, I'm Abby! Hello! I am a graphic design student at Algonquin College. My passion lies in illustration and branding, where I enjoy creating vibrant and bold designs. I also like to dabble in motion graphics and website design! My three years at Algonquin have been some of the best in my life; I learned so much about design. I also made some of the best friendships I've ever had. I'm very grateful to have been able to experience this!
