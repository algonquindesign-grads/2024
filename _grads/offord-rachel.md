about_me: |
  My entire art journey began in elementary school; I enjoyed adding colors to coloring books as a child. I referenced some artists' works to learn how to illustrate, and later applied to Algonquin College to study Graphic Design, aiming to expand my knowledge of using Adobe Software and not limit myself to illustration. During college, I explored various types of graphic design, and I found motion works to be the most enjoyable to learn.
