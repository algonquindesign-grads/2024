about_me: |
  Design has always been a big part of me. Ever since a kid, drawing was a way for me to express myself and show off my interests. When I first started designing, it opened up a whole world of possibilities. This program has taught me many new things and helped me hone my skills, not only to express myself better but also helped me work with other talented designers.
