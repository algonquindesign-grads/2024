about_me: |
  I’m an energetic graphic and motion designer. I have a passion for telling stories that excite and inspire others. Aside from my studies in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College, have formal training in photography and videography. I also dabble in comic art and music production. I strongly believe every project is an opportunity to make a target audience feel—and I’ll never pass up on that! Let’s make waves, one story at a time!

portfolio_title1: "2024 Motion Reel"
portfolio_description1: |
  All of my best motion work from the past year is included. 2D? 3D? I love to do it all!
portfolio_title2: "Animated Short: Ronin"
portfolio_description2: |
   A brooding animated short inspired by Japanese ink paintings. Approaching the short, I wanted to build moody tension, all leading up to epic and cathartic story beats.
