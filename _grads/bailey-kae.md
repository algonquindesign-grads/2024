about_me: |
  This program has given the knowledge and tools to be able to get working on any project, regardless of the medium, and work to incorporate strong messages and symbolism inside them. In my eye, I believe a graphic that tells a story, or a journey is a perfect graphic. Going forward, I'll miss studying and bouncing ideas off of everyone, but I'm excited to see where we all end up!
