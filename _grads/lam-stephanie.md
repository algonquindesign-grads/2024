about_me: |
  Hello! I’m Stephanie, a Chinese-Canadian graphic designer from Markham. I am eager to hone my skills in web and motion design so that I can help the many local Chinese restaurants in Markham reach a broader audience. During the development of our grad show, I was tasked with all the data entry you see here on this site as well as troubleshooting any functionality issues such as HTML and CSS glitches. When I'm not designing you can find me experimenting in the kitchen or collecting stationery supplies.
