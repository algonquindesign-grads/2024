about_me: |
  I'm Ritu: a fondness of Dada and Surrealism, and, more generally, the place where Art History meets aesthetics and artistic movements is an enduring creative inspiration. My background in design is rooted in a BA in Fashion Design, during which I lived and worked in Delhi, India, and London, U.K. More recently, I completed a three-year program in Graphic Design, in Ottawa, Canada; I love combining both worlds. My creative-style is experimental, emotive and in the pursuit of creating brand-new. I'm keen on collaboration in newfangled creative content.
