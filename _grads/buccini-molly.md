about_me: |
  I came into this program with a visual art background and expected to leave as an illustration-focused designer. But that is only one passion I have honed in these three years. At Algonquin, I learned that I enjoy the versatility of design—I appreciate novelty, and am highly curious about learning new skills. I have reflected on my work and myself, including my strengths and weaknesses, and I am eager to take the next step in my journey as a designer. I’m still finding my way, and I strive to infuse my work with joy, audaciousness, and a bit of the offbeat.

portfolio_description1: |
  Sleek and clean is my motto when it comes to good motion design. This piece skillfully elevates my logo redesign for the Ottawa bar and billiards establishment, The Orange Monkey.
portfolio_title2: "Branding for Personal"
portfolio_description2: |
   With funky colours and cosmic motifs, each individual piece is its own story, while being united under my personal brand.
portfolio_title3: "Sticker Designs for the 9 Muses"
portfolio_description3: |
  Behold, the gospel truth. Using my illustration skillset with vector-making software, I gave a personal look to each Greek muse—Melpomene is my favourite.
