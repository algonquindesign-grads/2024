about_me: |
  I'm a graphic designer fueled by a passion for motion, illustration. While I enjoy all aspects of design, motion graphics is definitely my favourite, and I hope to pursue it further in my design journey. Being in the program has broadened my design perspective in ways I hadn't imagined, and I'm grateful for the skills I picked up along the way. I can't wait to learn more and start sharing my creative ideas in the field.
