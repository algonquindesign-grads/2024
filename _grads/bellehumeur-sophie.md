about_me: |
  I am a graphic designer who specializes in branding. I have always loved drawing and painting, which has led me to this program. I've discovered from this experience the passion I have for finding creative out-of-the-box solutions in design. I love being in any kind of collaborative environment, connecting with other designers and those in my program has been extremely beneficial to my growth as a graphic designer.
