about_me: |
  I have always loved colourful things, fun shapes, and bold designs. This program has taught me how to apply these treatments in impactful and digestible ways to compliment the story being told. I am excited to be entering the graphic design industry alongside such an inspiring and talented cohort. I could not be more proud of the ways we have all grown as designers and individuals over the last 2 years.
