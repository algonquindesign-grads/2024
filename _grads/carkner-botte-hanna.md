about_me: |
  As a designer, I love to use bright colours, vibrant patterns, and bold typefaces to create a fun visual experience. I'm very inspired by other creatives and enjoy sharing my passions. I can be found drinking way too many coffees while racking my brain over trying to create a competent sketch. Illustrator is my best friend and I will happily take vectors over a pencil any day! Design has always been my love and I am lucky to get to explore that.

  I created two uniquely Ottawa beers named Bytown Logger and Parliament Pawsse. These two designs pay homage to the city's history.

portfolio_description2: |
   I rebranded the Saunder's Farm 'Fright Fest' to be more family-oriented fun. This ticket design shows how Halloween can be implemented in a fun way!
portfolio_title3: "Drink Menu"
portfolio_description3: |
  This drink menu is part of a menu creation assignment we did. I love using a fun pattern and I think the soothing greens ties it all together.

  This party invitation is meant to be coming from your cool friends, so the vibes have to match that.
