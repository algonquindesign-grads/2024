about_me: |
  Drawing inspiration from my life abroad, father's artistry and my mother's diplomacy, I passionately share and communicate my ideas with others. It only took a lifetime to realize my purpose and this program really helped me get there! The insight provided to us on how the industry works, how to communicate with clients and knowing what our work is worth really made me feel ready to take my next steps in my career.
