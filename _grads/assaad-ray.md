  Hiya, I'm Ray, a graphic designer currently enrolled in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. My passion for art and design dates back to my early years, and as I matured, it naturally led me to pursue graphic design. The program at Algonquin has equipped me with a diverse skillset, enabling me to further explore my love for design. My strength lies in innovative thinking, consistently pushing creative boundaries and embracing the unpredictable twists and turns of the creative rollercoaster. I find joy not only in designing but also in using my skills to help others.
