about_me: |
  Hey I’m Bryar! I love vibrant and bold designs. If I can create things that bring joy and make people laugh, I will. I am also not afraid to tackle serious subjects and use my skills to bring awareness. I love working with typography and flat illustration. This program has helped me to grow and truly shaped me into the designer I am. I was able to find my style and was ecstatic to incorporate it into my personal branding. I’m mainly interested in working with print, branding, and typography. I am, however, open to all avenues. Ultimately, I am eager to put to practice all the things that I have learned along the way and excited to fill the world with pristine colour palettes.
