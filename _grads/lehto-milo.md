about_me: |
  I'm a lifelong artist from Northern Ontario - I love creating and designing, and finding new things to try. I specialize in branding, print, and typography, and in my free time you'll likely find me either in Toronto visiting my friends, or in some random bush looking for cool mushrooms.
