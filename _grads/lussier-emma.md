about_me: |
  I’m a junior Graphic Designer and Illustrator from Ottawa, Canada. I like to look at things creatively. In the last few years I have studied not only Graphic Design but completed the Illustration and Concept Art program. This has allowed me to work with a variety of art and design. I enjoy storyboarding, illustration, motion graphics and branding. Outside of work I like to read, crotchet, hang out with friends and spend time with family and my 2 dogs.
