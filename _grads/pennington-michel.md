  Enthusiastically creative and detail-oriented, I'm a passionate graphic designer driven by a belief in design's power to influence perceptions and behaviors. With a strong altruistic spirit, I use design to address social issues and empower individuals for positive change. My journey into design was sparked by a desire for creative expression, problem-solving, and a commitment to accessibility and inclusivity.
