about_me: |
  Hey! I'm Bryan, a designer who's all about creating unique and memorable projects. My graphic design journey started in 2022 at Algonquin College, where I learned to blend design, art, and craft. Throughout my academic journey, I discovered my purpose in graphic design, developing a keen interest in branding, illustration, motion, and various design-related aspects. Fueled by a persistent sense of wonder, I am committed to translating your design aspirations into tangible reality.
