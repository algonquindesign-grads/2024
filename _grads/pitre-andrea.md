about_me: |
  I've always been at home with the arts, and vector based illustrations have been a comfort since childhood. My creative curiosity has led me to web and motion design, mediums that I hope to use to educate, and/or brighten someone’s day! I’m hardworking, happy to learn, and love to experiment with my craft. I also rock to 90s grunge, enjoy a good spooky movie, and squeeze in time to play video games when I can.
