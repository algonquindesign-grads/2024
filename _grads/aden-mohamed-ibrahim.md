  Hi, bonjour, I'm a junior graphic designer based in Ottawa, Ontario. Throughout the years, I've consistently infused my work with creativity and unwavering dedication. Along this path, I've had the privilege of delving into the realms of branding, illustrations, packaging design. As I move forward, I'm excited to channel my focus and expertise into these specific areas.

portfolio_description1: |
  The Multifaith Housing Initiative is a non-profit organization committed to offering affordable and efficient housing options for low-income families. My experience in the Barrhaven housing community has been both fulfilling and unforgettable. Motivated by the warmth and inclusivity of this setting, I've initiated a personal campaign project to spotlight its admirable qualities.

   
portfolio_title3: "Menu Redesign"
portfolio_description3: |
  For this project, my aim was to revamp the menu for Curio, a restaurant renowned for its hip and enigmatic ambiance. Embracing this essence, I opted to infuse a touch of magic into the design. Drawing inspiration from the fantastical elements found in fantasy literature and gaming, I envisioned the menu as a grimoire—a spell book.
